# Weather-Dashboard
This is a simple and easy to use weather dashboard with a form input that allows you to view the weather outlook for multiple cities so as a traveler, you may travel and pack accordingly. Ensuring you know what to bring and wear.


The OpenWeatherAPI is used to retrieve weather data for cities and `localStorage` is used to have the data persist for it in the application.
